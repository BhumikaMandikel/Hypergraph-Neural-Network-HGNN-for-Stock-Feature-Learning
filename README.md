# Hypergraph Neural Network (HGNN) for Stock Feature Learning

## Overview

This project implements a Hypergraph Neural Network (HGNN) for analyzing and predicting stock market features across multiple tickers. By leveraging the power of hypergraph structures, the model captures complex relationships and dependencies between different stocks, market sectors, and temporal patterns that traditional graph neural networks might miss.

## What is a Hypergraph Neural Network?

Unlike traditional graphs where edges connect only two nodes, hypergraphs allow edges (called hyperedges) to connect multiple nodes simultaneously. In the context of stock analysis, this enables the model to:

- Capture sector-wide correlations (e.g., all tech stocks moving together)
- Model complex market events affecting multiple assets
- Represent higher-order relationships between stocks, market indicators, and temporal factors
- Learn intricate patterns that involve multiple stocks simultaneously
